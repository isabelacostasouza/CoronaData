# Data segmentation

There are multiple sources we can retrieve data from:
  - City Hall Website Bulletin
  - Mayor's Twitter
  - City Newspapers
 
For each source, at least one method of segmentation must be done.

**If possible, do not extract the entire newsletter; only the relevant parts (that is, potentially having the data to be extracted)**

A segmentation of one city can work for other cities: try to make it as generic as possible, without loss of precision.
Eventually, it may be necessary to use machine learning to extract the date.
