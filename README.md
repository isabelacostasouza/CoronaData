# Corona: Data Collector
This code has the purpose of helping brazilian people to collect relevant data from oficial reports about the new Corona Virus.

### Dependencies
<br />
**Data segmentation**: It does not depend on any module. There can be several forms of segmentation. Try to make it as generic as possible.

**Data extraction**: Depends on Segmentation to finish, however, you can do some tests in sample cities without needing the segmentation of this particular city to be ready. Also try to make it as generic as possible

**Database**: The creation of the database does not depend on any previous task. You can also import into the drive with test data

**Collaborative collecting**: It does not depend on any task. However, it depends on the database being created for finalization

**Machine learning**: it depends that the Segmentation of some cities are ready to do the manual labeling.

**Mold method**: Finally, it depends on whether manual labeling (machine learning) has been carried out. Nothing prevents us from doing tests with any manual labeling
<br /><br />
**For tasks that do not depend on the database, save / read initially in CSV and then import into the database.**
