# Data extraction

The extraction will be done from the data collected by the data sementation results.
It can be done in several ways:

  - Machine learning methods
  - Regular expressions
  - Pattern selection

**Extraction for one city can work for other cities: try to make it as generic as possible, without loss of precision.**

Generally, the bulletins of a city are similar: right for one, great chance to hit all
